<p><strong>Animation Project For Introduction to Multimedia</strong></p>
<p>One of the assignments I did for MMP 100 was in class, where we were assigned to make an animation in After Effects. The audio I chose was from Tangled the series, and the background I used was medieval themed, which I found on the internet. However, the characters themselves do belong to me because I made them in Illustrator. I synced their head movements with the audio, created the magical axe in Illustrator, duplicated the axe so one was glowing and the other wasn't, simply to create the effect that the axe started glowing.</p>
<p><strong>Vector Project For Digital Graphic Design</strong></p>
<p>For this assignment in MMA 100, I was tasked with creating a vector drawing from three choices: a shopping bag, a floor plan, or a favorite outfit. I chose an outfit because it seemed easier to do, and I already had an outfit in mind that was from a fashion mobile game. It had a Korean idol look to it, which I really liked, and started planning it out. I took a picture and traced out the design on paper. The design on the dress was created by Illustrator's generative fill and I was told to input what my interests were on the dress.</p>
<p><strong>Documentary for Digital Film</strong></p>
<p>This assignment is a group project where my group and I were given topics we have decided to do. I was the boom operator and audio editor. This documentary is about the difficulties that colored women have faced with their natural curly hair.</p>
<p><strong>My First Audio Creation for Introduction to Multimedia</strong></p>
<p>For this assignment, I was tasked with creating an audio clip using Audacity. I chose to make a clip of an 1800s-era affair. It's about a noble woman named Octavia who was enjoying a feast that she and her husband Himmel were invited to at the castle. Not knowing where her husband disappeared to, she went to go find him and bring him a glass of wine but caught him cheating with another woman. Most of the sounds were found on freesound.org and the rest like a woman gasping and music is from youtube.</p>
